No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\line distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\line Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\line Contributor:\line\line (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\line     or\line\line (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\line     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\line     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\line     Version); or\line\line (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\line     its Contributions.\line\line This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\line or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\line the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\line\line 2.4.

Distribution of Source Form\line\line All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\line Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\line the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\line Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\line License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\line attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\line Form.\line\line 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\line\line If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\line\line (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\line     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\line     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\line     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\line     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\line\line (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\line     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\line     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\line     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\line\line 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\line\line You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\line provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\line the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\line Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\line Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\line License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\line under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\line the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\line Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\line License(s).\line\line 3.4. Notices\line\line You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\line (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\line or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\line the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\line the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\line\line 3.5. Application of Additional Terms\line\line You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\line indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\line Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\line behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\line such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\line You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\line liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\line indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\line disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\line jurisdiction.\line\line\cf5 4. \cf1 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\line\cf5 ---------------------------------------------------\line\line\cf1 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\line License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\line statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\line the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\line describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\line be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\line Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\line or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\line recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\line\line\cf5 5. \cf1 Termination\line\cf5 --------------\line\line\cf1 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\line if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\line compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\line Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\line Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\line ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\line non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\line come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\line Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\line notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\line first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\line from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\line Your receipt of the notice.\line\line 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\line infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\line counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\line directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\line You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\line 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\line\line 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\line end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\line have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\line prior to termination shall survive termination.\line\line\cf5 ************************************************************************\line * \cf6                                                                      *\line\cf5 *  6. \cf1 Disclaimer of Warranty                                           *\line\cf5 *  \cf1 -------------------------                                           *\line\cf5 * \cf6                                                                      *\line\cf5 *  \cf1 Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *\line\cf5 *  \cf1 basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *\line\cf5 *  \cf1 statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *\line\cf5 *  \cf1 Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *\line\cf5 *  \cf1 particular purpose or non-infringing.
